# 📊 Pandas EDA – Exploratory Data Analysis on NBA Dataset

This repository contains my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Pandas**, performed on an **NBA dataset (`nba.xlsx`)**.

The project focuses on **understanding, cleaning, and analyzing real-world data**, using **step-by-step explanations and well-commented code**.  
It is designed as a **beginner-to-intermediate level project** for learners moving beyond Pandas basics.

## 🧠 Project Motivation

After learning core Pandas concepts, I wanted to:
- work with a **real dataset**
- understand how analysts explore data before modeling
- practice **data cleaning and analysis techniques**

This project reflects **my learning transition** from basic Pandas usage to **practical data analysis using EDA**.
